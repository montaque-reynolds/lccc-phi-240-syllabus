# Communication

Discord and email are my preferred methods of communication. I am on Discord during workday hours, though I may be “away” during meetings and while I attend to other business. I also may have limited availability between 8-4:30pm. I will also
monitor Discord during weekday evening hours and will respond to messages if I am able. Likewise, I dedicate time to email responses each workday, meaning that my response time is typically within 24 hours during the workweek. Please use your LC email account when emailing me. For both email and Discord, if you have not received a response from me after 48 hours (or by end of business on Monday if you messaged me over the weekend), please follow-up to ensure that your message did not get
lost in the shuffle.

All messages regarding course updates, assignments, and changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will be posted on the _news channel in Discord. Changes to the class schedule, including cancellations, will also sent to your LC email account. It is imperative that you check both Slack and your SLU email account regularly.

Please also ensure that all concerns or questions about your standing in the course are directed to me immediately. Inquires from parents, SLU staff members, and others will not be honored.
