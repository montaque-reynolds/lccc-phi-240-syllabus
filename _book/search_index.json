[["evaluation-and-grading.html", "Evaluation and Grading", " Evaluation and Grading Much of the learning that you do in this course will be done at home. What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in. Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, (c) level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises including “entry” and “exit” tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation. Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. This scale is available to you at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g140Jx843x7aekG5fe8zyVbwymVSW8Rd-I3BX4VvqMI/edit?usp=sharing. and: Your participation grade will be a cumulation of the points you’ve earned on each of the assignments, plus those points you earned through participation and attendance.
