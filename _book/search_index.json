Course Description This course, PHIL 1700, invites students to explore enduring philosophical questions and to reflectively evaluate the various answers given them by thinkers from a range of social, historical, and religious contexts. Students will tackle ultimate questions in a range of philosophical domains, including issues such as the nature of self and ultimate reality, morality and human meaning, rationality and the pursuit of truth. The aim of the course is to give students an opportunity to critically examine their own beliefs and commitments in dialogue with each other and with great thinkers past and present.

Some Helpful Resources PhilPapers: https://philpapers.org/ Provides a helpful overview of the field. It maps the relationships between various philosophers and disciplines within philosophy. Stanford (online) encyclopedia of philosophy https://plato.stanford.edu/ My search algorithm is likely going to be vastly different than yours. However, if you search up almost any philosophical question followed by “sep”, you may likely find a link to an article on this page with an extensive development and critical reflection of that question. Wi-Phi Many of our videos will come from here https://www.wi-phi.com/videos/ All-Sides https://www.allsides.com/unbiased-balanced-news If you have ever worried about media bias, this website does a good job of scoring various publications according to any potential bias. This will be helpful since we will be looking at some articles about contentious issues and consider whether we are influenced by the truth of a claim, or by persuasive speech. "],["evaluation-and-grading.html", "Evaluation and Grading", " Evaluation and Grading Much of the learning that you do in this course will be done at home. What this means, is that instead of applying what have learned in the classroom at home, working on a problem, writing a paper, etc., you will instead apply what you have learned at home, in the classroom. I will provide ample opportunity for you to apply in class what you have learned at home. This includes assignments, discussion participation, reading feedback (i.e., this reading was difficult because . . .). Each of these aspects will together comprise your grade in the course. Ultimately, what you learn, and the grade you will receive, will be up to you. You will get as much out of this course as you put in. Both attendance and participation are critically important aspects of this class. The class participation grade will be based on (a) attendance, (b) level of engagement during discussions and group exercises, (c) level of engagement on discord, and (d) the completion of other exercises including “entry” and “exit” tickets, the student information sheet, a pre-test, and an end of the semester course evaluation. Each of these elements is assigned a point value and assessed using a scale that awards full, partial, or no credit. This scale is available to you at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g140Jx843x7aekG5fe8zyVbwymVSW8Rd-I3BX4VvqMI/edit?usp=sharing. and: Your participation grade will be a cumulation of the points you’ve earned on each of the assignments, plus those points you earned through participation and attendance.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 1.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
