# Veteran Services

We support our veteran and service member students and their families by

providing a Veteran Services Department and a Veteransâ€™ Resource Center. This department

supplements the assistance provided by Enrollment, Advising and Financial Aid. You can

confidentially discuss academic or personal issues. Referrals will be made as needed to campus

and/or community assistance. Contact Sarah Albright (BA 2450) at 618-468-5312 or

salbright@lc.edu.
